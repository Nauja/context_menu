# Features

context_menu was created as due to the lack of an intuitive and easy to use cross-platform context menu library. The library allows you to create your own context menu entries and control their behavior seamlessly in native Python.

## What is the context menu?

The context menu is the window that is displayed when you right click:

![img.png](media/context_menu.png)

The context menu is different depending on what was right clicked. For example, right clicking a folder will give you different options than right clicking a file. 

## What Operating Systems are supported?

Currently, the only operating systems supported are:
 - Windows 7
 - Windows 10
 - Windows 11
 - Linux (Using Nautilus)

## What Python versions are supported?

**All python versions 3.1 and above** are supported.

# Installation  

If you haven't installed Python, download and run an installer from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python, the rest is super simple. Simply just run the following command in a terminal to install the package:
```commandline
python -m pip install context_menu
```
or if you're on Linux:
```commandline
python3 -m pip install context_menu
```
_Note: If you're on Windows and it says the command isn't recognized, make sure to add [Python to your path](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/) and run the command prompt as administrator_

# Quickstart

1.  If you haven't already Install the library via pip:
```commandline
python -m pip install context_menu
```
2. Create and compile the menu:

You can create menus in as little as 3 lines:

```python
    from context_menu import menus
    fc = menus.FastCommand('Example Fast Command 1', type='FILES', command='echo Hello')
    fc.compile()
```
![example fast command](media/example_fast_command.png)

Or you can create much more complicated nested menus:

```Python
def foo2(filenames, params):
    print('foo2')
    print(filenames)
    input()

def foo3(filenames, params):
    print('foo3')
    print(filenames)
    input()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from context_menu import menus

    cm = menus.ContextMenu('Foo menu', type='FILES')
    cm2 = menus.ContextMenu('Foo Menu 2')
    cm3 = menus.ContextMenu('Foo Menu 3')

    cm3.add_items([
        menus.ContextCommand('Foo One', command='echo hello > example.txt'),
    ])
    cm2.add_items([
        menus.ContextCommand('Foo Two', python=foo2),
        cm3,
    ])
    cm.add_items([
        cm2,
        menus.ContextCommand('Foo Three', python=foo3)
    ])

    cm.compile()
```

# Detailed Usage

## `ContextMenu` Class

The [ContextMenu](https://context-menu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context_menu.html#context_menu.menus.ContextMenu) object holds other context objects. It expects a name, and the activation type if it is the root menu(the first menu). Only compile the root menu.

```Python
ContextMenu(name: str, type: str = None)
```

Menus can be added to menus, creating cascading context menus. You can use the [{MENU}.add_items{ITEMS}](https://context-menu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context_menu.html#context_menu.menus.ContextMenu.add_items) function to add context elements together, for example:

```Python
cm = menus.ContextMenu('Foo menu', type='DIRECTORY_BACKGROUND')
cm.add_items([
    menus.ContextMenu(...),
    menus.ContextCommand(...),
    menus.ContextCommand(...)
])
cm.compile()
```

You have to call [{MENU}.compile()](https://context-menu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context_menu.html#context_menu.menus.ContextMenu.compile) in order to create the menu.

## `ContextCommand` Class

The [ContextCommand](https://context-menu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context_menu.html#context_menu.menus.ContextCommand) class creates the selectable part of the menu (you can click it). It requires a name, and either a Python function or a command **(but NOT both)** and has various other options

```Python
ContextCommand(name: str, command: str = None, python: 'function' = None, params: str=None, command_vars: list=None)
```

Python functions can be passed to this method, regardless of their location. **However, the function must accept only two parameters `filenames`, which is a list of paths\*, and `params`, the parameters passed to the function**. and if the function is in the same file as the menu, you have to surround it with `if __name__ == '__main__':`

Any command passed (as a string) will be directly ran from the shell.

## `FastCommand` Class

The [FastCommand](https://context-menu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/context_menu.html#context_menu.menus.FastCommand) class is an extension of the ContextMenu class and allows you to quickly create a single entry menu. It expects a name, type, and command/function.

```python
FastCommand(name: str, type: str, command: str = None, python: 'function' = None, params: str = '', command_vars: list = None)
```

```python
def foo1(filenames, params):
    print(filenames)
    input()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    from context_menu import menus

    fc = menus.FastCommand('Example Fast Command 1', type='FILES', python=foo1)
    fc.compile()
```

~~Admin privileges are required on windows, as it modifies the Registry. The code will automatically prompt for Admin rights if it is not sufficiently elevated.~~

# Advanced Usage

## `removeMenu` method

You can remove a menu easily as well. Simply call the ['menus.removeMenu()'](<>) method.

```python
removeMenu(name: str, type: str)
```

For example, if I wanted to remove the menu 'Foo Menu' that activated on type 'FILES':

```python
from context_menu import menus

menus.removeMenu('Foo Menu', 'FILES')
```



## `params` Command Parameter

In both the `ContextCommand` class and `FastCommand` class you can pass in a parameter, defined by the `parameter=None` variable. **This value MUST be a string!** This means instead of passing a list or numbers, pass it as a string separated by spaces or whatever to delimitate it.

```Python
fc = menus.FastCommand('Example Fast Command 1', type='FILES', python=foo1, params='a b c d e')
fc.compile()
```

For more information, [see this.](https://github.com/saleguas/context_menu/issues/4)

Works on the `FastCommand` and `ContextCommand` class.

## `command_vars` Command Parameter

If you decide to pass a shell command, you can access a list of special variables. For example, if I wanted to run a custom command with the file selected, I could use the following:

```Python
fc = menus.FastCommand('Weird Copy', type='FILES', command='touch ?x', command_vars=['FILENAME'])
fc.compile()
```

which would create a new file with the name of whatever I selected with an 'x' on the end. The `?` variable is interpreted from left to right and replaced with the selected values [(see this)](https://github.com/saleguas/context_menu/issues/3).

All of the preset values are as follows:

| Name          | Function                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| FILENAME      | The path to the file selected           |
| DIR/DIRECTORY | The directory the script was ran in.    |
| PYTHONLOC     | The location of the python interpreter. |

Works on the `FastCommand` and `ContextCommand` class.

## Opening on Files

Simply pass the extension of the file you want to open onto when creating the menu.

```Python
fc = menus.FastCommand('Weird Copy', type='.txt', command='touch ?x', command_vars=['FILENAME']) # opens on .txt files
fc.compile()
```

# Types

There are different locations where a context menu can fire (if you right click on a folder you'll get different options then if you right click on a file).  The `type` variable controls this behavior in the library, and you can reference this table to determine the `type`:

| Name                 | Location                                                           | Action                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| FILES                | HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\\*\\shell\\                  | Opens on a file                          |
| DIRECTORY            | HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\shell             | Opens on a directory                     |
| DIRECTORY_BACKGROUND | HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Directory\\Background\\shell | Opens on the background of the Directory |
| DRIVE                | HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\Drive\\shell                 | Opens on the drives(think USBs)          |

# Important notes

-   ~~The code can sometimes be really weird when it comes to admin rights on Windows. The `compile()` method will automatically prompt for admin rights if required, but this can cause issues sometimes.~~ Admin rights no longer required as of version 1.2.0.

-   Almost all of the errors I've encountered in testing were when the code and the functions were in the same file. You should make a separate file for the code or surround it with `if __name__ == '__main__':`.

Feel free to check out a [file sorter](https://github.com/saleguas/freshen) I made that implements very complex usage of this library.
